% Some very useful LaTeX packages include:
% (uncomment the ones you want to load)


% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/ifpdf
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of the IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 5.0 (2009-03-20) and later if using hyperref.sty.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/cite
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  % \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  % \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation
% can be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/graphicx
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/epslatex
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). The IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics.
%
% Note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/amsmath





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as the IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithms
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithmicx




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/array


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.




% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=normalsize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
%\else
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a larger sans serif font
% than the serif footnote size font used in traditional IEEE formatting
% and thus the need to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending
% on whether compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/subfig




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure.
% Be aware that LaTeX2e kernels dated 2015 and later have fixltx2e.sty's
% corrections already built into the system in which case a warning will
% be issued if an attempt is made to load fixltx2e.sty as it is no longer
% needed.
% The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/fixltx2e


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/stfloats
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as the IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that the IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as the IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/dblfloatfix




%\ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff
%  \usepackage[nomarkers]{endfloat}
% \let\MYoriglatexcaption\caption
% \renewcommand{\caption}[2][\relax]{\MYoriglatexcaption[#2]{#2}}
%\fi
% endfloat.sty was written by James Darrell McCauley, Jeff Goldberg and 
% Axel Sommerfeldt. This package may be useful when used in conjunction with 
% IEEEtran.cls'  captionsoff option. Some IEEE journals/societies require that
% submissions have lists of figures/tables at the end of the paper and that
% figures/tables without any captions are placed on a page by themselves at
% the end of the document. If needed, the draftcls IEEEtran class option or
% \CLASSINPUTbaselinestretch interface can be used to increase the line
% spacing as well. Be sure and use the nomarkers option of endfloat to
% prevent endfloat from "marking" where the figures would have been placed
% in the text. The two hack lines of code above are a slight modification of
% that suggested by in the endfloat docs (section 8.4.1) to ensure that
% the full captions always appear in the list of figures/tables - even if
% the user used the short optional argument of \caption[]{}.
% IEEE papers do not typically make use of \caption[]'s optional argument,
% so this should not be an issue. A similar trick can be used to disable
% captions of packages such as subfig.sty that lack options to turn off
% the subcaptions:
% For subfig.sty:
% \let\MYorigsubfloat\subfloat
% \renewcommand{\subfloat}[2][\relax]{\MYorigsubfloat[]{#2}}
% However, the above trick will not work if both optional arguments of
% the \subfloat command are used. Furthermore, there needs to be a
% description of each subfigure *somewhere* and endfloat does not add
% subfigure captions to its list of figures. Thus, the best approach is to
% avoid the use of subfigure captions (many IEEE journals avoid them anyway)
% and instead reference/explain all the subfigures within the main caption.
% The latest version of endfloat.sty and its documentation can obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/endfloat
%
% The IEEEtran \ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff conditional can also be used
% later in the document, say, to conditionally put the References on a 
% page by themselves.




% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/url
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.




% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

\section{Introduction}

\IEEEPARstart{O}f interest to any reactor physicist is a high resolution, spatial, temporal, and spectral representation of the in-core neutron flux of any reactor.
Within recent years, scientists at Kansas State University have made many developments in fission chamber technology, achieving goals like the reduction of local flux perturbation, point-like detector geometry and extreme widening of the power band \cite{reichenberger2016micro} \cite{reichenberger2018fabrication}.
Currently, these technologies, known as Micro-Pocket Fission Detectors, only employ a single fission chamber at each location which allow for detection of the total flux.
However, one can imagine the co-location of multiple chambers in the same nodal region, each containing a unique fissionable isotope, providing many more, and ideally independent, responses to the in-core spectral flux.
Although useful, there exist limitations on the ammount of information that can be extracted from a neutron signal using an increased number of fission chambers.
Geometric constraints and isotopic availability and manufacturing exist as two major limitations.
Another issue, the problem considered in this particular work, deals with the transformation of response data into the spectral neutron flux, specifically, the underdetermined problem of spectral deconvolution caused by both the uncertainty in the responses and the disparity between the response vector and the desired, larger neutron spectral flux vector.
Previously, a scoping study was completed demonstrating the performance of three deconvolution algorithms on this specific problem: minimum-norm, Tihkonov regularization, and maximum Shannon entropy unfolding \cite{roberts2018use}.
These algorithms serve as a starting point for approaching this problem; however, they each present certain pathologies that motivate the search for better performing methods.
The deconvolution algorithms MAXED and Gravel are two approaches presented in this work that address these specific issues and improve the overal error associated with the deconvoluted solution.


\section{Spectral Deconvolution}

Spectral deconvolution, also known as spectral unfolding, is a problem commonly found within neutron spectrometry.
It arises in part by the desire to produces a high resolution representation of the neutron flux spectrum featuring useful detail in special regions.
The equation governing the process, when represented as a summation, is expressed as follows:

\begin{equation}
  r_i + \epsilon_i = \sum_{g=1}^{N} \Sigma_{fg,i}  \phi_g\, , 
    \qquad i = 1 \ldots N \, ,
\label{eq:response}
\end{equation}

where each $r_i$ is the response of isotope $i$, $\epsilon_i$ is the error associated with $r_i$, $\Sigma_{fg,i}$ is the flux-weighted, integrated fission cross section for energy group $g$ for isotope $i$, and $\phi_g$ is the integrated flux in energy group $g$.
Known in this equation are the responses $r_i$, obtained from detector measurements, and assumed is the matrix $\Sigma$.
It is assumed because to flux-weight the cross section requires {\it a priori} knowledge of the true flux spectrum, the obtention of which is the goal of our work here.
Deconvolution refers to the class of methods used to obtain the flux vector.

Many different methods of deconvolution have been studied and shown to have varying levels of largely application-dependent success.
Two popular methods used in similar applications to this are included in the RSICC Peripheral Science Routine Collection, namely, MAXED and Gravel.

MAXED, arguably the more sophisticated of the two finds its basis in information theory and leverages the principle of maximum entropy \cite{reginatto1999maxed}.
It seeks to solve a system of equations comprised of \EQ{eq:response} and \EQ{eq:omega} while maximizing \EQ{eq:entropy}

\begin{equation}
  \sum \frac{\epsilon_i^2}{\sigma_k^2} = \Omega
\label{eq:omega}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
  S = - \sum [f_i \ln(f_i/f_i^{DEF}) + f_i^{DEF} - f_i]
\label{eq:entropy}
\end{equation}

In the above equations, $\Omega$ is a user-defined parameter that relates the unknown error $\epsilon_i$ to an assumed variance in response $\sigma_k^2$.
$S$ is the entropy we are trying to maximize, and $f_i^{DEF}$ is the default starting spectrum.
This maximization of $S$ is done through use of simulated annealing and detailed in Reginatto and Goldhagen \cite{reginatto1999maxed}.
The closed form solution allows for the propogation of uncertainty, a feature not available in other, iterative-type deconvolution methods.

Gravel employs a modified version of the Sand II algorithm which was first detailed in a 1967 report from the Air Force Weapons Laboratory \cite{mcelroy1967computer}.
The following equation describes the (relatively simple) algorithm:

\begin{equation}
 f_i^{J+1} = f_i^{J} \exp(\frac{\sum_k W_{ik}^J \log(\frac{N_k}{\sum_{i'} R_{ki'}f_{i'}^J})}{\sum_k W_{ik}^J}) 
\label{eq:sand}
\end{equation}

where $N_k$ is the measured response, $\sigma_k$ is the measurement error, $R_{ki}$ is the response matrix, and $W_{ik}^J$ is a weighting term:

\begin{equation}
 W_{ik}^J = \frac{R_{ki} f_i^J}{\sum_{i'} f_{i'}^J} \frac{N_k^2}{\sigma_k^2} 
\label{eq:weighting}
\end{equation}

$J$ represents the current iteration, $i$ is the energy group index, and $k$ is the response index.
Because there is no closed form solution to the algorithm, uncertainty propagation is not possible here \cite{reginatto2004umg}.



\section{Methods}

\begin{figure}[h!tb]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width = 0.49\textwidth]{../plot/umg_ds_gr}
  \caption{The default spectra used in unfolding.}
  \label{fig:default_spectra}
\end{figure}

A range of fissionable isotopes are theoretically available for use in fission chambers and so for various isotopic groupings, found in a \TAB{tab:isos}, unfolding was performed.
The response matrices used in unfolding were comprised of the condensed microscopic, fission cross sections for each of these groupings, which are shown in \FIG{fig:response}.
Not depicted in the figure are the shielded responses which were obtained via elementary approximation - that thermal neutron attenuation by 0.025 mm foils of each weighted the response function.
Because both of these algorithms require the use of a default spectrum, the interest in an analysis of this problem comes from the ability of the algorithms to recieve some typical flux spectrum and accurately reproduce a true flux spectrum.
An MCNP simulation was used to produce a representative flux spectrum for the KSU Triga Mark II research reactor and then detector responses were obtained by folding (integrating) this flux with the isotopic cross sections as found in the above equation.
Then, using four unique default spectra shown in \FIG{fig:default_spectra}, both unfolding methods were applied to each isotopic set and solution flux spectra were obtained.
Three of the default spectra were textbook PWR flux spectra with different magnitudes.
One was scaled to identical integrated flux as the true, TRIGA spectrum, the other two were multiplied by a scaling coefficient of 0.5 or 2.0, representing the theoretical range of mis-guessing the TRIGA's true absolute flux.
The other, uniquely-shaped spectrum was obtained by setting each bin's integrated flux to unity then scaling the overall flux to match that of the true spectrum.
The Wims69 group structure was used for this analysis.

\section{Results and Discussion}

\subsection{Default Spectra}

The unity spectrum stands out as the worst of the default spectra, exhibiting very noisy behavior between groups 20 and 40 and thus make it least useful for use to find a solution spectrum.
This is due in part to the group structure used.
The variance in bin width across the Wims 69 group structure forms peak behavior in this region when producing a unity spectrum that translates to inaccuracies in the unfolding process.
It is conceivable, then, that a structure with more uniformity across the spectrum might correlate to a smoother solution spectrum.

A second, obvious feature within the Gravel results in \FIG{fig:ds_sol_gr} is the indifference to starting total flux, given an identical flux spectral shape.
This contrasts with MAXED's clear dependence on integral flux, exibiting it's lowest average error for the low flux spectrum.
Another feature of interest is MAXED's adherence to the default spectra through the region bounded by approximately $1 \times 10^{-3}$ and $5 \times 10^{-1}$ MeV.
The maximum entropy principle discourages deviation from the default spectrum, and therefore is likely to exibit a consistent and unfavorable bias throughout this region for a wide range of default spectra.

Although trouble for the unity spectrum, all default spectra struggle to match the true spectrum within groups 20 through 40.
The low flux spectrum combined with MAXED outperforms any other combination within this section of analysis, highlighting the importance of default spectrum selection.

\end{figure}


\subsection{Isotopic Groups}

For the subsequent analysis, the `same flux' spectrum was used as the default spectrum.
For both programs, the addition of more responses generally leads to a decrease in the group-wise mean error.
However, when the neptunium and thorium resonses are included in the analysis, case 2 actually leads to an increase in error, visible in \FIG{fig:isos_err_gr} and \FIG{fig:isos_err_mx}.
This is likely due to the additional element's energy region of highest response.
They add a a degree of importance to capturing the detail in the lower end of the 1/E region and as a result, cause the erratic behavior while attempting to fix the solution spectrum.
MAXED generally outperforms gravel for the few response cases.
The matching along the entire 1/E region is better for MAXED, causing this outperformance.
It should be noted, however, that Gravel exhibits a higher capacity to capture detail, at lease in these cases; error is virtually non-existent in the high-energy, fission spectrum end of the curve, and the curvature around the low-energy, maxwellian region is more extreme, to match the true spectrum.
Restated, MAXED operates on a maximum entropy principle, so the spectrum is often less free than Gravel's to undergo more extreme shape changes in attempting to locate a solution spectrum.

\subsection{Shielded Responses}

It is with the inclusion of shielded responses that Gravel really begins to exhibit its usefulness.
Both programs continue to find improved spectra given additional repsponses, culminating in a value of 18.5\% by Gravel including the Cd and Gd responses.
For both programs, the Gd inclusion outperforms the Cd included responses, a pattern which does not hold true for other unfolding techniques \cite{roberts2018use}.

\section{Conclusion and Future Work}

The use of MAXED and Gravel unfolding codes has lead to the successful reduction in the absolute error associated with neutron spectral deconvolution, relative to other, simpler algorithms \cite{roberts2018use}.
For example, a decrease in the theoretical minimum group-wise error for case 3 from 63\% to 53.9\% is seen in lieu of shielded responses through MAXED, dropping to 27.8\% when considering different default spectra and with the incorporation of shielded responses, a decrease from 34.2\% to 18.5\% using Gravel.
Small in scope, this study provides preliminary proof of the usefulness of these methods; however, a much larger analsis should ultimately be done to inform future descisions like the selection of ideal spatial-dependent default spectra, and optimum isotopic groupings.
Also, this study by no means exhausts the realm of popular unfolding algorithms and there is room for the analysis of other codes within this same application.
The ideas presented here apply to broad notions of multi-isotope, fission chamber detectors, and as the technology develops, constraints presented by the technology can be incorporated into analysis giving a more realistic idea of the potential for such devices.
